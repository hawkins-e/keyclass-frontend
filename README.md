**KeyClass**
KeyClass is a speed typing game that tests a user's typing speed and accuracy.

**Motivation**
I created this game with my childhood in mind as I had a similar program in my elementary years that behaved in a similar fashion. This was originally created with children in mind but has proven to be a lot of fun for adults as well. 

**Code Style**

**Tech/Framework Used:**
React,

**How to Use?**

1. To get started, you'll first need to select a challenge from the dropdown box under the Choose A Challenge header. 
2. After selecting a challenge, move your cursor down to the input box. This is where you will type the challenge. 
3. Once you begin typing you need to type as quickly and as accuratley as possible, as the timer will start upon the first stroke within the input box. 
4. Last be sure to hit the submit button! This will cause the timer to stop and produce your overall typing speed in words per minute. 

#**Contribute**
