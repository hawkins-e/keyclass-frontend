**KeyClass**
KeyClass is a speed typing game that tests a user's typing speed and accuracy.

**Motivation:**
I created this game with my childhood in mind as I had a similar program in my elementary years that behaved in a similar fashion. This was originally created with children in mind but has proven to be a lot of fun for adults as well. 

**Code Style:**
js-standard-style

**Tech/Framework Used:**
React,
React-Spring, 
Semantic UI, 
Heroku 

**How to Use:**
1. Open KeyClass: https://keyclass-frontend.herokuapp.com/
<br>
2. Select a challenge from the dropdown box under the Choose A Challenge header. 
<br>
3. After selecting a challenge, move your cursor down to the input box. This is where you will type the challenge. 
<br>
4. Once you begin typing you need to type as quickly and as accuratley as possible, as the timer will start upon the first stroke within the input box. 
<br>
5. Last be sure to hit the submit button! This will cause the timer to stop and produce your overall typing speed in words per minute. 

**Future Improvements:**
I would like to implement multi-player functionality by utilizing web sockets.
